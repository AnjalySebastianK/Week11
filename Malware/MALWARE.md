# Malware - An Overview

## Introduction
Malware (short for **Malicious Software**) is any program or file designed to disrupt, damage, steal, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.  
It is one of the most common cyber threats faced by individuals, organizations, and governments.

---

## Characteristics of Malware
- Designed with **malicious intent** (stealing, damaging, spying, disrupting).
- Can be **self-replicating** or require user interaction.
- Often disguised as **legitimate software** or hidden in files.
- May target **data, system performance, or user privacy**.

## Common Types of Malware

### 1. **Viruses**
- Attaches itself to files or programs.
- Spreads when infected files are shared.
- Example: Melissa Virus (1999).

### 2. **Worms**
- Self-replicates and spreads without user interaction.
- Exploits vulnerabilities in networks.
- Example: ILOVEYOU Worm (2000).

### 3. **Trojans**
- Disguised as legitimate software.
- Provides backdoor access to attackers.
- Example: Zeus Trojan (banking malware).

### 4. **Spyware**
- Secretly monitors user activity.
- Steals sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers).
- Example: CoolWebSearch.

### 5. **Adware**
- Unwanted advertisements.
- Slows down system performance.
- Often bundled with free software.

### 6. **Ransomware**
- Encrypts user data and demands ransom for decryption.
- Example: WannaCry (2017).

### 7. **Rootkits**
- Provides administrator-level control to attackers.
- Hides the presence of malware.
- Very difficult to detect.

### 8. **Backdoors**
- Creates hidden entry points into systems.
- Used for persistent unauthorized access.

### 9. **Botnets**
- Network of infected devices (zombies).
- Used for launching large-scale attacks (e.g., DDoS).

## Real-World Impact
- **Data theft**: personal, financial, and corporate information.
- **Financial loss**: billions of dollars lost annually.
- **System downtime**: disrupting services and productivity.
- **Reputation damage**: organizations lose trust.
- **National security risks**: malware used in cyber warfare.

## Prevention & Defense

### Best Practices
- Install and update **antivirus/antimalware software**.
- Keep **OS and applications patched**.
- Use **firewalls and intrusion detection systems**.
- Practice **safe browsing and email habits**.
- Backup data regularly.
- Use **strong, unique passwords** + MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

### Incident Response
1. Detect suspicious activity.
2. Isolate infected systems.
3. Analyse malware behaviour.
4. Remove malware using trusted tools.
5. Restore from clean backups.
6. Strengthen security controls.
