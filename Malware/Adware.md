# Adware – Detailed Explanation

---

## What is Adware?
**Adware** (short for *advertising-supported software*) is a type of software that automatically delivers advertisements to a user’s device.

- Adware can be **legitimate** (free apps displaying ads) or **malicious** (tracking user behavior without consent).
- It often generates revenue for the developer or attacker through **ad impressions, clicks, or redirecting traffic**.
- Some adware can also act as a **privacy threat**, collecting sensitive data or installing additional malware.

## How Adware Works

1. **Installation**
   - Often bundled with free software, downloads, or pirated apps.
   - May be installed without explicit consent (drive-by installs).

2. **Displaying Ads**
   - Shows pop-ups, banners, or in-app ads.
   - Can redirect browsers to sponsored websites.

3. **Data Collection**
   - Tracks browsing history, search queries, geolocation, or system information.
   - Sends data to the attacker or advertising network.

4. **Secondary Actions**
   - Sometimes installs additional malware (trojans, spyware).
   - Slows down system performance and consumes bandwidth.

## Types of Adware

1. **Standalone Adware**
   - Applications whose main purpose is to show ads.

2. **Bundled Adware**
   - Installed along with free software or pirated programs.

3. **Browser-Based Adware**
   - Browser extensions or plugins that inject ads into webpages.

4. **Tracking Adware**
   - Monitors user behaviour to serve targeted advertisements.

## Tools / Techniques Used

- **Bundlers** – Package adware with other software.
- **Malvertising** – Using online ads to deliver malware.
- **Browser Hijackers** – Modify browser settings to show ads.
- **SDKs in Mobile Apps** – Mobile ad networks integrated into apps for revenue.

## Case Studies / Real-World Examples

1. **Fireball Adware** – Infected millions of PCs worldwide by hijacking browsers and collecting data.
2. **CoolWebSearch** – Redirected search engines, displayed pop-ups, and slowed systems.
3. **Bundled Adware in Freeware** – Many free apps on Windows and Android include adware that tracks user activity.

## Layer of the OSI Model Affected

- **Application Layer (Layer 7)** – Adware primarily operates at the application layer, interacting with browsers, apps, or pop-ups.
- **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** – Adware communicates with ad servers using TCP/UDP.
- **Network Layer (Layer 3)** – Adware sends user data and ad requests over IP networks.

## Detection & Prevention

**Detection:**
- Frequent pop-ups, banners, or browser redirects.
- Unusual CPU, memory, or bandwidth usage.
- Unknown applications or browser extensions installed.

**Prevention:**
- Avoid downloading software from untrusted sources.
- Use ad-blockers and anti-adware tools.
- Keep OS and applications updated.
- Regularly scan devices with antivirus/antimalware software.
- Carefully read installation prompts to avoid bundled adware.

## Summary
**Adware** is software designed to display advertisements and may collect user data. While some adware is legitimate, malicious variants compromise privacy, redirect traffic, and can deliver additional malware. Prevention includes using trusted sources, scanning for threats, and monitoring installed software.
