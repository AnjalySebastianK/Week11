# Backdoors â€“ Detailed Explanation

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Backdoor?
A **backdoor** is any hidden or undocumented method that allows bypassing normal authentication or security controls to gain remote or local access to a system, application, or network. Backdoors let an actor return to an environment without re-exploiting the original vulnerability that granted access.

They can be:
- **Malicious** (planted by attackers),
- **Accidental/legacy** (debugging hooks left by developers), or
- **Deliberate/authorized** (maintenance accounts â€” but still risky).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Classification & Common Forms
**By location/type**
- **Application backdoors**: hidden code paths, hard-coded credentials, maintenance hooks inside apps.
- **Web shells**: small scripts (PHP/ASP/JSP) uploaded to a web server that run commands or upload/download files.
- **System backdoors/rootkits**: kernel modules, drivers, or altered system binaries that hide their presence and provide access.
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: malware that opens a remote control channel (GUI, shell access, file transfer).
- **Firmware/BIOS backdoors**: malicious or modified firmware in BIOS, UEFI, NICs, storage controllers.
- **Hardware backdoors**: tampered chips or hardware logic inserted into the supply chain.
- **Cloud backdoors**: long-lived API keys, misconfigured IAM roles, exposed management endpoints or compromised CI/CD pipelines.
- **Webhooks/third-party backdoors**: compromised/malicious third-party libraries, updates, or modules.

**By origin**
- **Supply-chain backdoors** (trojanized updates, compromised libraries)
- **Post-exploit backdoors** (planted after initial compromise)
- **Insider/backdoor accounts** (hidden admin accounts)

## ðŸ”¹ How Attackers Install/Maintain Backdoors
Typical methods:
- Exploit a vulnerability and drop a small implant that spawns a persistent backdoor.
- Upload a web shell via file upload vulnerability or misconfiguration.
- Abuse stolen credentials or poorly protected SSH keys to create an account / install a service.
- Poison builds artefacts or compromises vendor update channels (supply chain).
- Plant firmware or hardware modifications (more advanced / nation-state).
- Abuse legitimate management channels (remote management interfaces, cloud APIs).

Backdoors often include:
- A **beacon** (periodic check-in) to Command & Control (C2).
- Support for **modules** (file exfiltration, lateral movement, privilege escalation).
- **Fallbacks** (multiple C2 domains, DGA, cloud storage as drop).
- **Persistence** mechanisms to survive reboots and evade removal.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Typical Communication & C2 Techniques
- **HTTP/S** requests to attacker-controlled domains (often disguised as normal traffic).
- **DNS** (TXT or C2 via DNS queries).
- **ICMP**, **SMTP**, or other less-monitored protocols.
- **Peer-to-peer (P2P)** networks for resilient C2.
- **Cloud services** (storage buckets, paste sites, social media APIs) used as covert channels.
- **Tor / Proxy networks** and **domain fronting**.
- **DGA** (Domain Generation Algorithms) to rotate domains if one is taken down.

Communication is usually **encrypted** or obfuscated.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Persistence Techniques
- OS run keys/registry Run/RunOnce (Windows)
- Scheduled tasks/cron jobs
- Installed services/daemons
- Modified init scripts, systemd units
- SSH authorized_keys entries, hidden accounts
- Kernel drivers, signed drivers
- Firmware implants or modified bootloaders
- Web server scripts (web shells)
- Container images with malicious layers or CI/CD pipeline compromise

---

## ðŸ”¹ How Backdoors Evade Detection
- Code obfuscation/packers
- Process injection into trusted processes
- Signed binaries or abuse of legitimate tools
- Fileless implants that live only in memory
- Living off the land (PowerShell, certutil, curl)
- Stealthy beaconing with low frequency
- Fast-flux / multiple C2 for resilience

---

## ðŸ”¹ Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
**Host signals:**
- Unknown services or scheduled tasks
- New user accounts or privilege escalations
- Unexpected registry or cron entries
- Unsigned DLLs in legitimate processes
- Files in unusual locations

**Network signals:**
- Outbound connections to suspicious IPs/domains
- Periodic beaconing
- DNS requests to many rare domains
- Large or unexplained data uploads
- TLS sessions with unusual fingerprints

**Log signals:**
- Web server POSTs with base64 or eval payloads
- Unusual authentication attempts
- CI/CD pipeline anomalies

---

## ðŸ”¹ Forensic & Incident Response Steps
1. Identify & scope affected hosts
2. Isolate affected hosts
3. Preserve evidence (memory, disk, logs)
4. Collect network captures
5. Analyze memory, executables, and web logs
6. Hunt for persistence artefacts
7. Remediate credentials
8. Eradicate implants / rebuild systems
9. Recovery with monitoring
10. Post-incident review & update detection rules

---

## ðŸ”¹ Detection & Defensive Controls
- EDR solutions for process injection & persistence
- Network monitoring for unusual outbound traffic
- Egress filtering
- MFA and least privilege
- Hardened configurations
- Application whitelisting
- File integrity monitoring
- Code signing & supply-chain security
- Secure CI/CD pipelines
- Firmware & BIOS protections

## ðŸ”¹ Notable Real-World Backdoor Cases
- **SolarWinds / SUNBURST**: supply chain backdoor affecting thousands
- **Juniper ScreenOS**: hidden code for VPN decryption
- **Web shells on CMS sites**: persistent remote access

## âœ… Summary
A **backdoor** is a hidden entry point bypassing authentication for long-term access. They appear in many forms â€” web shells, RATs, firmware implants, supply-chain trojans â€” and are used for espionage, data theft, or later-stage attacks. Defence requires monitoring for persistence, hardening credentials and builds, using EDR, and incident response, including isolation and forensic collection.
