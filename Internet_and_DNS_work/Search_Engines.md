# How Search Engines Work

---

## Overview
Search engines (like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo) help users find relevant information on the internet.  
Behind the simple search box lies a **complex system** that crawls, indexes, ranks, and retrieves web pages.  

This README explains the **step-by-step process** of how search engines work.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Crawling
- Search engines use **bots/spiders/crawlers** to browse the internet.  
- Crawlers follow **links** from one page to another.  
- They collect **raw data** such as page content, metadata, and URLs.  

---

### 2. Indexing
- Collected pages are processed and stored in a **search index**.  
- Index contains **keywords, content type, URL, metadata, and ranking signals**.  
- This allows the search engine to quickly retrieve results during a query.  

---

### 3. Processing Search Queries
- When a user types a query, the search engine interprets it:  
  - Detects **keywords**.  
  - Understands **user intent** using AI/NLP.  
  - Applies **language and location** context.  

---

### 4. Ranking
- The search engine ranks pages based on **relevance and authority**.  
- Common factors:  
  - Keyword matches  
  - Backlinks (quality and quantity)  
  - Content quality and freshness  
  - Page speed and mobile-friendliness  
  - User engagement metrics  

---

### 5. Retrieving Results
- The engine fetches the **most relevant pages** from its index.  
- Results are sorted based on ranking signals.  
- Typically displays **10 organic results** per page plus ads, snippets, or knowledge panels.  

---

### 6. Displaying Results
- Search results page (SERP) shows:  
  - Title  
  - URL  
  - Meta description  
  - Rich features (images, videos, maps, etc.)  
- Users click results, sending traffic to the respective websites.
