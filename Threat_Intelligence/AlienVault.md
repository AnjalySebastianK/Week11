# AlienVault OTX – Open Threat Exchange

---

## Overview
**AlienVault OTX (Open Threat Exchange)** is a **community-driven threat intelligence platform** that enables researchers, security teams, and organizations to **share and access Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**.  

It provides:  
- **Threat data** → Malicious IPs, domains, URLs, file hashes.  
- **Pulses** → Bundles of related IOCs describing a specific threat, campaign, or malware family.  
- **APIs** → To integrate with SOC, SIEM, firewalls, and security tools for automated enrichment.  

---

## How It Works
1. **Threat Data Collection**  
   - Security professionals and researchers upload IOCs.  
   - Data is grouped into **pulses** for context.  

2. **Community Sharing**  
   - Pulses are shared openly.  
   - Users can subscribe to feeds from researchers, vendors, and organizations.  

3. **Search & Analysis**  
   - Search IPs, domains, file hashes, or URLs to check for malicious reputation.  

4. **Integration with Security Tools**  
   - OTX can feed IOCs into SIEM, IDS/IPS, and firewalls.  

---

## Features
- **Pulses** → Bundled collections of IOCs about a single threat.  
- **IOC Lookups** → Search IPs, domains, URLs, file hashes.  
- **Subscriptions** → Follow specific researchers and organizations.  
- **OTX DirectConnect** → Feed OTX data directly into security platforms.  
- **Community Collaboration** → Shared intelligence from thousands of contributors.

## Usage

### Web Portal
1. Sign up at [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com).  
2. Search for **IP, domain, URL, or file hash**.  
3. Review related **pulses, threat actors, campaigns, and malware families**.  
4. Subscribe to relevant feeds for continuous updates.

## Case Examples

### Malicious IP Detection
- SOC detects traffic to a suspicious IP.  
- OTX reveals it’s part of a **botnet C2 infrastructure**.  
-  **Action:** Block IP, investigate host.  

### Phishing Domain
- Security analyst checks `secure-login-update.com`.  
- OTX shows a domain flagged in a **phishing pulse**.  
-  **Action:** Add to blocklist, warn users.  

### Malware Hash Lookup
- File hash extracted during IR.  
- OTX lookup shows link to **Emotet malware campaign**.  
-  **Action:** Update detection rules, quarantine infected systems.  

---

## Limitations
- **Community-driven** → Risk of false positives.  
- **Coverage gaps** → Not all threats are reported.  
- **Not always real-time** → Some delays in detection.  
- **Requires correlation** → Should be combined with other TI sources.  

---

## Best Practices
- Use OTX for **threat enrichment**, not sole decision-making.  
- Cross-check results with **VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, ThreatFox, etc.**  
- Subscribe to pulses relevant to your **industry or geography**.  
- Automate IOC ingestion into **SIEM/SOC pipelines**.
