# Keyloggers – Detailed Explanation  

---

## What is a Keylogger?  
A **keylogger** (short for *keystroke logger*) is a type of **surveillance malware** or monitoring software that records everything a user types on a keyboard.  
It is often used by:  
- **Attackers (malicious use):** To steal passwords, banking details, or personal messages.  
- **Employers/parents (legitimate use):** To monitor employee activity or parental control.  
- **Law enforcement (authorised use):** For digital forensics and investigations.

## How a Keylogger Works  
1. **Installation** – Delivered via phishing emails, malicious downloads, trojans, or physical access.  
2. **Recording Keystrokes** – Captures every key pressed by the user (e.g., passwords, chats).  
3. **Data Storage/Transmission** – Logs are either:  
   - Saved locally in hidden files.  
   - Sent remotely to the attacker via email, FTP, or command-and-control servers.  
4. **Persistence** – Hides itself by disguising as a legitimate process or rootkit.  
5. **Exfiltration** – Data is retrieved by the attacker for misuse (identity theft, fraud, espionage).

## Types of Keyloggers  

1. **Software-based Keyloggers**  
   - Run as a hidden program inside the OS.  
   - Can log keystrokes, screenshots, clipboard data, and browser activity.  

2. **Hardware Keyloggers**  
   - Devices physically attached between keyboard and computer (USB dongles, inline connectors).  
   - Require physical access.  

3. **Kernel/Driver-based Keyloggers**  
   - Operate at the **kernel level**, intercepting system calls.  
   - Very stealthy and hard to detect.  

4. **Browser-based Keyloggers**  
   - Malicious scripts running inside a web browser.  
   - Capture form inputs (e.g., credit card, login details).  

5. **Wireless Keyloggers**  
   - Intercept wireless keyboard signals (RF sniffing).  

6. **Acoustic/Optical Keyloggers** (Advanced)  
   - Use sound or electromagnetic emissions to capture keystrokes.

## Tools Related to Keyloggers  

- **For Attackers (illegitimate use):**  
  - Ardamax Keylogger, Refog, Spyrix, HawkEye.  

- **For Security Testing / Research:**  
  - Wireshark (detects suspicious transmissions).  
  - Sysinternals Suite (detect hidden processes).  
  - Process Explorer, Autoruns.  
  - Antivirus/EDR tools (Kaspersky, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne).

## Famous Keylogger Cases & Outbreaks  

1. **Zeus Trojan (2007–2010)**  
   - One of the most dangerous banking trojans with built-in keylogging.  
   - Stole millions of dollars from online banking customers.  

2. **HawkEye Keylogger (2019)**  
   - Sold as "malware-as-a-service".  
   - Targeted businesses worldwide, exfiltrating credentials.  

3. **Olympic Destroyer (2018 Winter Olympics)**  
   - Used keylogging among other tools to disrupt the event.  

4. **Remote Access Trojans (RATs) like Agent Tesla & NanoCore**  
   - Keylogging is often included as a **feature** inside RATs.

## Which Layer Does a Keylogger Affect?  

- **Application Layer (Layer 7):** Browser keyloggers, form grabbers.  
- **Operating System Layer:** Kernel-level, API hooking keyloggers.  
- **Hardware Layer:** USB and physical keyloggers.  

 Unlike worms/viruses (network/file focused), keyloggers focus on **user interaction data** (keyboard input).

## Extra Insights  

- **Motives:** Credential theft, financial fraud, espionage, employee monitoring.  
- **Impact:** Identity theft, stolen bank details, privacy invasion.  
- **Modern Trend:** Keyloggers are increasingly bundled with **spyware, trojans, and RATs**.  
- **Prevention:**  
  - Use updated antivirus & EDR solutions.  
  - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
  - Virtual keyboards / on-screen keyboards for sensitive info.  
  - Monitor system processes & outbound traffic.

## Summary  
A **keylogger** is a surveillance tool that records keystrokes to steal sensitive data. It can exist as **software, hardware, kernel-level, or browser-based malware**. Keyloggers have been part of major cyberattacks like **Zeus Trojan** and **HawkEye**. They affect multiple layers (Application, OS, Hardware), making them versatile and dangerous.
