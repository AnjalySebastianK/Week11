# Phishing – Detailed Explanation  

---

## What is Phishing?  
**Phishing** is a **social engineering attack** where attackers impersonate trusted entities (banks, companies, friends) to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as:  
- Login credentials  
- Banking details  
- Credit card numbers  
- Personal or organizational data  

Phishing relies more on **human manipulation** than technical exploits.

## How Phishing Works (Lifecycle)  
1. **Bait Creation** – Attacker creates fake websites, emails, or messages resembling a trusted source.  
2. **Delivery** – Phishing email/SMS/IM is sent to the target.  
3. **Deception** – Victim clicks a malicious link or opens an attachment.  
4. **Data Harvesting** – User credentials, financial details, or personal data are stolen.  
5. **Exploitation** – Stolen information is used for fraud, identity theft, or network intrusion.
